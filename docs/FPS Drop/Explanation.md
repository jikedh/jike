Your goal will be to help me find the source of a performance problem in a React App. I collected a large dataset about this specific performance problem.

We have the high level time of how much react spent rendering, and what else the browser spent time on during this slowdown

- react component render time: 30ms
- other time (other JavaScript, hooks like useEffect, style recalculations, layerization, paint & commit and everything else the browser might do to draw a new frame after javascript mutates the DOM): 206.19999998807907ms


We also have lower level information about react components, such as their render time, and which props/state/context changed when they re-rendered.

Component Name:CanvasFlow
Rendered: 1 times
Sum of self times for CanvasFlow is 6ms
Changed state for all CanvasFlow instances ("hook index:count" pairs)
222:1x



You may notice components have many renders, but much fewer props/state/context changes. This normally implies most of the components could have been memoized to avoid computation

It's also important to remember if a component had no props/state/context change, and it was memoized, it would not render. So a flow we can go through is:
- find the most expensive components
- see what's causing them to render
- determine how you can make those state/props/context not change for a large set of the renders
- once there are no more changes left, you can memoize the component so it no longer unnecessarily re-renders.


An important thing to note is that if you see a lot of react renders (some components with very high render counts), but other time is much higher than render time, it is possible that the components with lots of renders run hooks like useEffect/useLayoutEffect, which run outside of what we profile (just react render time).

It's also good to note that react profiles hook times in development, and if many hooks are called (lets say 5,000 components all called a useEffect), it will have to profile every single one, and this can add significant overhead when thousands of effects ran.

If it's not possible to explain the root problem from this data, please ask me for more data explicitly, and what we would need to know to find the source of the performance problem.
